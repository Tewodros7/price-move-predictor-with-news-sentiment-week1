# Key Classes and Their Responsibilities

   **financial_news/data_load.py**

DataLoad: Handles loading and preprocessing of the financial news dataset.

  **financial_news/analysis.py**

Analysis: Provides methods for conducting analytical operations on financial news data.

  **financial_news/visualization.py**

Visualization: Responsible for generating visual representations of the financial news dataset.

  **stock/analysis.py**

StockAnalysis: Offers analysis tools for stock price data.

  **stock/visualization.py**

StockVisualization: Generates visualizations for stock-related metrics and trends.

# Advantages of the Class-Based Design
✅ Functional Organization
Encapsulates data loading, analysis, and visualization into dedicated classes.

Promotes code readability and reuse.

✅ Ease of Extensibility
Additional methods can be added without disrupting the existing structure.

Facilitates modular updates and clean inheritance.

✅ Intuitive Structure
Clearly named classes aligned with specific responsibilities.

Methods are logically grouped, simplifying usage and maintenance.

✅ Direct Notebook Logic Integration
Each method directly reflects a corresponding Jupyter notebook cell.

Original behavior and outputs are preserved with no abstraction.
